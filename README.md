# John Daudelin's Personal Website [OUTDATED]

NOTE: For my most recent personal website, see [this repository](https://github.com/Cowboy46/john-daudelin-profile).

This is a one-page, personal bio web page that I created my freshman year at NJIT using a simple bootstrap template called "One Page Wonder" by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

The site is hosted [here](https://web.njit.edu/~jed34/old-profile).
